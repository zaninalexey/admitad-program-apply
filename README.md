# Apply for new CPA programs in 1 click
Instead of manually clicking hundreds of times, do it with simple extension via 1-click

## Step 1. Install extension
Enable developer mode in Chrome on Extensions page and Load Unpacked extension from "admitad" folder

## Step 2. Navigate to program list
Open in browser program list on Admitad with needed filters applied.

## Step 3. Apply for programs
Press extension button in navigation panel. A default message (set via Admitad interface) will be used.

Be aware, all tabs will be open at once. So if you have a slow PC, limit the number of programs per page via Admitad.com interface.

The extension waits for the tabs to be loaded, then apply for program, then closes the tab. If nothing happend, try setting all the as active one by one (as sometimes Chrome does not send "loaded" message if there are too many tabs).
