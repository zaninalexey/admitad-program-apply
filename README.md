# Apply for new CPA programs on Admitad.com in 1 click
Instead of manually clicking hundreds of times, do it with simple extension via 1-click. Simply navigate to program list and press extension button. The extension will open new tabs with all programs visible on the page and will automatically apply for participation.

## Step 1. Install extension
Enable developer mode in Chrome on Extensions page and Load Unpacked extension from "admitad" folder

## Step 2. Navigate to program list
Navigate to program list on Admitad with needed filters applied (URL like https://www.admitad.com/ru/webmaster/websites/*/offers/)

## Step 3. Apply for programs
Press extension button in navigation panel. A default message (set via Admitad interface) will be used.

Be aware that all tabs will be open at once. So if you have a slow PC, limit the number of programs per page via Admitad.com interface.

The extension waits for the tabs to be loaded, then applies for a program, then closes the tab. If nothing happens, try focusing on each new tab one by one as sometimes Chrome does not mark tab as "loaded" message if there are too many tabs until it is not focused on.
